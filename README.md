# Housing_Dashboard_Project_2

As people get older, sometimes the desire to set down roots and buy a house springs up. At that point, many people start looking at the market and wonder when is the best time to buy. There are a lot of considerations that go into buying a house including location, price, features inside, etc. and it can get overwhelming. This project looks at the housing prices in San Deigo county between the years  of 2004 to 2018 to help see what neighborhoods have changed prices and what the housing market looks like in general. This can  be hosted locally on a computer using Flask and simple instructions are below
